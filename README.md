💥  Hi, I’m Sebastian. I'm a software engineer 💥 

I'm originally from Boston/Paris but based in Berlin and speak 🇺🇸 🇫🇷 🇪🇸 fluently. But traveling is definitely my passion (30 countries visited so far! 🥳) 
I've done a lot of backpacking.

✨ I’m interested in software, data, MMA and music ✨
🌱 I’m always learning several things at once. Currently I am:
          🍎 Perfecting my skills in building and deploying React/React Native software
          🖤 Learning how to build audio software in the JUCE framework
          🌬 Perfecting my Kiteboarding skills
          ⚡️ Diving deeper into all facets of electronic synthesis
