💥 Hi, I’m Sebastian. I'm a software engineer 💥

I'm originally from Boston/Paris but based in Berlin and speak 🇺🇸 🇫🇷 🇪🇸 fluently. Traveling is definitely my passion (30 countries visited so far! 🥳) I've done a lot of backpacking. I’m interested in software, data, MMA and music. I’m always learning several things at once. Currently I am: 


  ​				🍎 Perfecting my skills in building and deploying React/React Native software

  ​				🖤 Learning how to build audio software in the JUCE framework

  ​				🌬 Perfecting my Kiteboarding skills

  ​				⚡️ Diving deeper into all facets of electronic synthesis
